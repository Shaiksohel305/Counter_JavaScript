A creating a counter application with click tracking is a great beginner-friendly project to enhance understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
I will build a simple web application with the following features:
a) A counter that displays the current count.
Buttons to increment decrement and reset the count.
Display the number of clicks for both increment and decrement actions, resetting after clicks the reset button.
